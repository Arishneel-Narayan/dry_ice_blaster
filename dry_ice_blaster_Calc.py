    * **Electricity Cost per kWh:** Based on BCF's average commercial rate. 
    * **Revenue per Hour of Production:** This is a critical input that significantly impacts the overall benefit. Ensure this value is accurately estimated for BCF.

    * **Enhanced Worker Safety and Morale:** Eliminates chemical exposure, reduces physical strain, and improves working conditions.
    * **Environmental Responsibility:** No secondary waste (water, chemicals), uses recycled CO2, contributing to a smaller environmental footprint.
