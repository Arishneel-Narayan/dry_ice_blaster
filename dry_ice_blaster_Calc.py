* **Dry Ice Blaster Power Consumption:** Assumed to be constant during the cleaning session hours.
* **Electricity Cost per kWh:** Based on your facility's average commercial rate.
* **Dry Ice Blaster Lifespan:** Not explicitly calculated in annual cost, but influences long-term CAPEX planning.
* **Revenue per Hour of Production:** This is a critical input that significantly impacts the overall benefit. Ensure this value is accurately estimated for BCF.
* **Return on Investment (ROI) Calculation:** Calculated as `(Net Financial Benefit - Subsequent Years / Dry Ice Blaster Purchase Cost) * 100`. This provides an annual ROI after the initial investment is absorbed.

* **Improved Hygiene and Food Safety:** Superior cleaning, crucial for meeting stringent food safety standards (reduced risk of recalls, enhanced brand reputation).
* **Extended Equipment Lifespan:** Non-abrasive method preserves conveyor belts and associated machinery, reducing long-term capital expenditure.
* **Enhanced Worker Safety and Morale:** Eliminates chemical exposure, reduces physical strain, and improves working conditions.
* **Environmental Responsibility:** No secondary waste (water, chemicals), uses recycled CO2, contributing to a smaller environmental footprint.
* **Consistent Cleaning Quality:** Automated nature ensures a more uniform and deep clean compared to manual variations.
