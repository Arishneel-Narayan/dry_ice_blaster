* **Staff Hourly Cost:** Includes wages, benefits, and general overhead.
* **Dry Ice Blaster Staff:** Assumed 1 operator for dry ice blasting.
* **Dry Ice Blaster Power Consumption:** Assumed to be constant during the cleaning session hours.
* **Electricity Cost per kWh:** Based on BCF's average commercial rate. 
* **Revenue per Hour of Production:** This is a critical input that significantly impacts the overall benefit. Ensure this value is accurately estimated for BCF.
* **Return on Investment (ROI) Calculation:** Calculated as `(Total Net Financial Benefit over {machine_lifespan_years} Years / Dry Ice Blaster Purchase Cost) * 100`.
    * **Underlying Assumption:** The annual net financial benefit (operational savings + revenue gain) is assumed to be constant each year after the initial investment year.
* **Simple Payback Period Calculation:** This calculates the time it takes for the cumulative net benefits to equal the initial investment.
    * **Underlying Assumption:** The annual net financial benefit is assumed to be constant each year.

st.markdown("""
* **Improved Hygiene and Food Safety:** Superior cleaning, crucial for meeting stringent food safety standards (reduced risk of recalls, enhanced brand reputation).
* **Extended Equipment Lifespan:** Non-abrasive method preserves conveyor belts and associated machinery, reducing long-term capital expenditure.
* **Enhanced Worker Safety and Morale:** Eliminates chemical exposure, reduces physical strain, and improves working conditions.
* **Environmental Responsibility:** No secondary waste (water, chemicals), uses recycled CO2, contributing to a smaller environmental footprint.
* **Consistent Cleaning Quality:** Automated nature ensures a more uniform and deep clean compared to manual variations.
